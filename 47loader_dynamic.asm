        ;; "Dynamic" loader.  Loads a table of addresses and data
        ;; lengths, then loads the blocks at the specified addresses.
        ;;
        ;; The table consists of the 16-bit address in big-endian
        ;; format, followed by the 16-bit data length in big-endian
        ;; format.  Only bits 0-14 of the length entry define the
        ;; length; bit 15 is a flag indicating whether to change the
        ;; load direction before loading the block.
        ;;
        ;; On initial entry to loader_dynamic, forward loading is
        ;; assumed.
        ;;
        ;; Define the following:
        ;;
        ;; LOADER_DYNAMIC_TABLE_ADDR:
        ;; the address at which to load the table.
        ;;
        ;; LOADER_DYNAMIC_INITIAL:
        ;; if defined, this is the address of a routine to call to fetch
        ;; the length of the table.  If not defined, loader_entry is used.
        ;;
        ;; LOADER_DYNAMIC_FORWARDS_ONLY:
        ;; if defined, direction changes are disabled; define this to
        ;; save a few bytes if all the dynamic loads are forwards.
        ;;
        ;; LOADER_DYNAMIC_ONE_BYTE_LENGTHS:
        ;; if defined, the table uses only a single byte to store each
        ;; length and direction change flag.  All dynamic blocks are
        ;; thus no larger than 127 bytes.
